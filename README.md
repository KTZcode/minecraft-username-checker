# minecraft username checker

This simple Python script will check, from a list of names, if any of them are available. If any are it will open them in name.mc on a new tab in your webbrowser.

Requirements: 
Python 3
Python requests module

usage:
put a list of names in the "names.txt" file and run "username_checker.py"

Note: I have little experience with programming and this may be a very inefficient way of doing this, I do not know.
