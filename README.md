# minecraft username checker

This simple Python script will check, from a list of names, if any of them are available. If any are, it will open them in [namemc.com](https://namemc.com/) on a new tab in your webbrowser for you to confirm if they are truly available or just "available soon".

Requirements: 
Python 3 ([python.org](https://www.python.org/)) and
Python requests module ([requests.readthedocs.io](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/))

usage:
put a list of names in the "names.txt" file and run "username_checker.py" and it will output to "namelog.txt"

Note: I have little experience with programming and this may be a very inefficient way of doing this, I do not know.
